# CS130-Capstone-Project

## Motivation/Concept:

In our current economy, many companies are laying off qualified employees left and right due to market constraints. Just between Facebook (Meta), Google, and Amazon, there have been 70,000 layoffs just in 2022. This situation coupled with the fact that companies have severely decreased headcount for new grad roles introduces a major problem for job-seekers across experiences of finding the right role for themselves. 

Although there are many existing job boards available through sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Handshake, they all suffer from two core problems that leads to a painful candidate experience: 
(1) Online job boards tend to have a large amount of listings due to the low overhead cost for companies to post jobs, but this leads to an overwhelming amount of options for the candidate – some of which are roles that are not relevant at all to their background.
(2) Current job boards also gravitate towards cluttered, overwhelming, and confusing interfaces, where the user is forced to navigate through different pages or links, just to find even one suitable opportunity for their background.

It is clear that the current job board experience creates two core problems for users that leads to them wasting valuable time and stresses them out during an already demanding process. Our idea is to build a more modern two-sided job board experience that focuses on saving time for applicants and matching them to the most relevant jobs available. Our experience will prioritize two goals: avoid overwhelming the user and present the most relevant jobs to the user. 

Job-seekers will be able to create accounts with their relevant experience attached, and find + apply to roles on the board. Employers will be able to create jobs, tag them with roles, and also post them for applicants to apply through.

As a stretch goal, we also plan on leveraging cutting-edge AI like the ChatGPT API to enhance the strength of our job board experience. Job-seekers can use the API’s powerful capabilities to identify and fill in gaps within their profile to decrease the time it may take for them to identify the right opportunity.


## Automation:
An automated build will be triggered on every push and pull request. To perform the build localy adhere to the following instructions:
1. Open the cloned repository in your favorite IDE

2. Open a Terminal window and navigate to the intellijob_backend directory

3. Type the command npm run build

Open a second Terminal window and navigate to the intellijob_webapp directory

Type the command npm run build

Now you have a production build on your local machine!
